Poorly chosen receiver name

<blockquote>
The name of a method's receiver should be a reflection of its
identity; often a one or two letter abbreviation of its type suffices
(such as "c" or "cl" for "Client"). Don't use generic names such as
"me", "this" or "self", identifiers typical of object-oriented
languages that place more emphasis on methods as opposed to functions.
The name need not be as descriptive as that of a method argument, as
its role is obvious and serves no documentary purpose. It can be very
short as it will appear on almost every line of every method of the
type; familiarity admits brevity. Be consistent, too: if you call the
receiver "c" in one method, don't call it "cl" in another.
